      <h2>How Our AI Skin Analysis Works</h2>

      <p>Our advanced AI Skin Analysis Scanner uses your phone’s camera to evaluate your skin in real time. It reads tone, texture, hydration levels, pore visibility, fine lines, dark spots, and sensitivity markers — all without any extra tools.</p>

      <p>The scanner compares thousands of data points and matches them with dermatologist-backed research and ingredient databases to create a personalized skin profile.</p>

      <p>Your results help guide product recommendations, treatments, and professional matches tailored specifically to your needs.</p>

      <h2>Skin Type Analysis</h2>
      <p>Your skin type determines how products react and perform. Here's how to identify yours:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Normal:</strong> Balanced tone, minimal shine or dryness.</li>
        <li><strong>Dry:</strong> Tightness, flaking, dullness after cleansing.</li>
        <li><strong>Oily:</strong> Shine through the day, larger pores.</li>
        <li><strong>Combination:</strong> Oily T-zone, dry or normal cheeks.</li>
        <li><strong>Sensitive:</strong> Easily irritated, reactive to temperature/products.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>Try this:</em> Wash your face, wait 30 minutes, then observe.</p>

        <li><strong>Wavy (2):</strong> Loose S-shape, moderate frizz.</li>

        <li><strong>Coily (4):</strong> Tight curls, delicate and moisture-loving.</li>
